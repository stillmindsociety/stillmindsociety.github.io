    <!-- Our Story -->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Still Mind Society emerged from a simple observation: in our rush to stay constantly connected and perpetually productive, we've lost touch with the profound power of pause.</p>
            <p>We are four creators—an interior designer, graphic designer, game developer, and digital designer—who recognized that our most breakthrough ideas didn't come during endless Slack notifications or infinite scroll sessions. They came during walks, showers, and those "boring" moments when our minds were free to wander.</p>
            <p>Our cracked circle logo represents this philosophy perfectly. It's not a broken circle—it's a circle that has opened to infinite possibility. The crack is where the light gets in, where new ideas emerge, where stillness transforms into creative energy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>The Cracked Circle</h3>
            <p>Our brand symbol embodies the beautiful paradox of our mission. A perfect circle represents completeness, stillness, the meditative state. But it's the crack—the deliberate disruption—that makes it powerful.</p>
            <p>This crack represents:</p>
            <ul class="stack-sm">
              <li>• The moment boredom becomes creativity</li>
              <li>• The break in routine that sparks innovation</li>
              <li>• The pause that allows reflection</li>
              <li>• The stillness that contains infinite potential</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's calmness, deliberately disrupted—not destroyed, but transformed.</p>

          <h2>Our Values in Action</h2>
          <p class="text-balance">These four principles guide everything we create, from digital experiences to physical spaces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stack-xl">
          <div class="grid grid-2">
            <div class="card">
              <h3>1. Digital Balance</h3>
              <p><strong>Thrive online while protecting reflective space.</strong></p>
              <p>We believe technology should amplify human potential, not hijack attention. Our approach to digital design prioritizes intentional interaction over addictive engagement. We create tools that help people connect meaningfully, then step away cleanly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>2. Intentional Rhythm</h3>
              <p><strong>Know when to speed up and slow down; let stillness speak.</strong></p>
              <p>Life has natural rhythms—seasons of intense focus and seasons of reflection. We design experiences that honor both states, helping people recognize when to push forward and when to pause, breathe, and listen.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="grid grid-2">
            <div class="card">
              <h3>3. Creative Disruption</h3>
              <p><strong>Chase norm-challenging ideas and fresh perspectives.</strong></p>
              <p>True innovation comes from questioning assumptions. We deliberately disrupt conventional thinking about productivity, success, and constant connectivity. Sometimes the most radical act is doing nothing at all.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>4. Boredom as Gateway</h3>
              <p><strong>Embrace boredom as a pathway to creativity and connection.</strong></p>
              <p>Boredom isn't a problem to solve—it's a doorway to walk through. When we stop filling every moment with input, we create space for output, insight, and genuine human connection to emerge naturally.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility & Wellbeing</h2>
            <p>Our commitment to mental wellbeing extends to digital accessibility. We believe that creating calm, inclusive experiences isn't just good design—it's a moral imperative.</p>
            <p>Every project we undertake considers:</p>
            <ul class="stack-sm">
              <li>• Cognitive load and mental energy</li>
              <li>• Sensory sensitivities and overstimulation</li>
              <li>• Diverse ways of processing information</li>
              <li>• The need for control over one's environment</li>
              <li>• Respect for different attention patterns</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Design for Human Flourishing</h3>
            <p>We reject the attention economy's premise that human focus is a resource to be mined. Instead, we design for human flourishing—creating experiences that leave people feeling energized, not depleted.</p>
            <p>This means building in natural stopping points, respecting user agency, and always providing an elegant way to disengage. Because the best technology knows when to get out of the way.</p>
