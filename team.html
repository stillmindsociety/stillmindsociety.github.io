            <h2>Creators, Not Consumers</h2>
            <p>We are Hannah, Sanaa, Matthew, and Kiaryn—an interior designer, graphic designer, game developer, and digital designer who came together around a simple realization: our most breakthrough moments happened during breaks, not during binges.</p>
            <p>Our Adventure Time-style avatars aren't just playful—they represent our commitment to approaching serious problems with creativity and wonder. In a world that often takes itself too seriously, we believe humor and humanity are essential tools for change.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Our Collective Journey</h3>
            <p>We met through various creative communities, each struggling with the same paradox: how to stay creatively vital in an attention economy designed to drain creativity.</p>
            <p>The breakthrough came when we realized we weren't fighting technology—we were fighting for intentionality. The enemy isn't our devices; it's the assumption that productivity requires constant input.</p>
            <p><strong>Still Mind Society</strong> is our answer: a creative collective dedicated to designing experiences that honor both focus and rest, engagement and reflection.</p>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Thinking</h3>
            <p>When an interior designer, graphic designer, game developer, and digital designer collaborate, magic happens. We bring different perspectives to every challenge:</p>
            <ul class="stack-sm">
              <li>• <strong>Physical space</strong> informs digital interface</li>
              <li>• <strong>Visual hierarchy</strong> influences game mechanics</li>
              <li>• <strong>Interactive design</strong> shapes environmental planning</li>
              <li>• <strong>User experience</strong> guides brand storytelling</li>

            <h3>Attention vs. Boredom</h3>
            <p>Our avatar style reflects a playful take on a serious battle: attention technology versus boredom as a creative gateway. We've chosen our side—we're team boredom.</p>
            <p>Not because we're against technology, but because we believe the most interesting innovations come from the spaces between interactions, the pauses between posts, the silence between sounds.</p>
